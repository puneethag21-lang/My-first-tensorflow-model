# My-first-tensorflow-model
 My first steps into machine learning using TensorFlow and Keras. This script trains a simple neural network to learn the linear relationship   from a small set of data points.

# Simple TensorFlow Linear Regression

This is a basic machine learning model that learns the relationship between two sets of numbers.

## The Problem
The model is given two arrays:
- **xs**: `[-1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]`
- **ys**: `[-2.0, 1.0, 4.0, 7.0, 10.0, 13.0]`

It learns that the relationship is **y = 3x + 1**.

## How to Run
1. Install TensorFlow: `pip install tensorflow`
2. Run the script: `python model.py`
